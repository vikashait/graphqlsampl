Goal: For the challenge, youâ€™ll be working with the loan level instead of the aggregate data from above. Please download the data from the following link: Loan Stats.  

The goal of the challenge is to create a backend that parses and aggregates the data provided above dynamically via an API endpoint for visualizing this data.  A good starting point for parameters to the API is date, state, grade or borrow FICO bands.
